## TODO items ##

- Create Interactors and corresponding model classes

- Create and hook listeners for RSMonitor

- implement Player methods
    -> Implemented, but some required values are hard to find in the RSPlayer.
       @Alaineman: please check implemented methods and verify these are 
                   correct. Some RSPlayer methods are unclear. -- Chronio

- implement GraphNetwork methods
    -> Implemented as Dijkstra algorithm, but still needs testing.
       @Alaineman: could you write a few tests that test the GraphNetwork's 
                   functionality? I'll be working on the RSMonitor. -- Chronio

- GUI for TaskManager and PG settings

- Add test classes and javadoc, and clean up classes
