            Provides interfaces that provide a way to listen for events
        </p>
        <p>
            This package mainly provides Listener interfaces for various RSBot
            and PowerGrid events. These events will be generated by the various 
            components in PowerGrid, and the RSBotMonitor class (in the 
            powergrid.control package). This class monitors RSBot and generates 
            the appropriate events when necessary.
