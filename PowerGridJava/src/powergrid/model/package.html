            This package features a collection of classes that act as the main 
            units of data in PowerGrid. This package contains, amongst others,
            a GameTile class, that represents a Tile in the Runescape world.
            This package also features a WorldMap class, which represents the 
            Runescape World (PowerGrid's default WorldMap instance is accessible
            through <code>powergrid.PowerGrid.MAPPER.getWorldMap()</code>).
