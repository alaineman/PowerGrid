Powerwalk
=========

Walking plug-in for RSBot.


Current functionality
---------------------
None at the moment, actually.


First upcoming functionality
----------------------------
The Bot is able to find paths using data from the RSBot environment.


Long-term planning
------------------
Eventually, the bot will be able to move around freely over the World Map, 
can use interactions, and can compute and follow paths from one point to another.
