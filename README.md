# PowerGrid #
PowerGrid is an extension on RSBot that aims to completely replace faulty or inefficient classes and methods with a completely new suite of classes and tools to make scripting much easier and less frustrating. 

## PowerGrid functionality ##
PowerGrid offers a completely new travelling system that allows the user to walk to any location in the Runescape world, while also using available teleports and shortcurs to get to the destination in the fastest possible way.

It also provides a mechanism to check a variety of stats and settings without needing to nagivate through widgets, PowerGrid automatically checks these when required, but caches the results so that consecutive calls are much faster.

PowerGrid offers a full user interface to travel to any destination or location using either landmarks, special locations such as banks and stores, or even an actual world map, allowing the user to click any tile on the map, after which PowerGrid computes a route and executes it for maximum control.

Scripters can use PowerGrid's functions to make scripts easier, but that's not all: PowerGrid comes with a unique plugin system, that allows scripters to create so-called Tasks that integrate seamlessly with the existing PowerGrid tasks to form larger, more complex tasks, making scripting much easier. Imagine the possibility of executing a task that gets you to the right location using only one line of code! These kind of possibilities make PowerGrid worthwhile, whether you're a scripter or an end-user.

Since PowerGrid does not simply run as a script in RSBot, but is actually using RSBot as a library, it is possible for PowerGrid to completely integrate in RSBot itself, providing a control bar right in the RSBot window for quick access to PowerGrid's functions.
