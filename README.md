Powerwalk
=========

Walking plug-in for RSBot.


Current functionality
---------------------
- The Bot can find paths between two points.
- The Bot is able to follow paths it computed.


First upcoming functionality
----------------------------
The Bot is able to work its way around (almost) all collisions and can smoothly walk 
from one place to another, as long as a direct path exists between the two points.

The Bot is able to use (simple) interactions that will help the bot to find more efficient paths between points.

Long-term planning
------------------
Eventually, the bot will be able to move around freely over the World Map, 
can use interactions, and can compute and follow paths from one point to another.
