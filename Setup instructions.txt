# Setup instructions for building and compiling PowerGrid #
 
PowerGrid is developed using the Qt Creator IDE, available from qt-project.org. To be able to compile the project, please follow the instructions for your OS.

The Qt libraries used to build and compile are quite large (around 400-650 MB, depending on your OS), so expect a download and installation time of about half an hour (at most, this again depends on your workstation and internet speed).


## For Windows ##

Download and install the Qt libraries + Qt Creator + MinGW in one go from qt-project.org/downloads (take the version labeled "Qt 5.0.2 for Windows 32-bit (MinGW 4.7, 650 MB)")

Once downloaded and installed, make sure that the following paths are added to your PATH variable.

;C:\Qt\Qt5.0.2\5.0.2\mingw47_32\bin;C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\jagexcache\jagexlauncher\bin

The reason we use this version is because it packs everything in one installer. We could use the 64-bit version for Visual Studio, but a) Visual Studio and Qt don't work together as well as expected, and b) the speedup we get from compiling in 64-bit is almost nothing since PowerGrid's speed heavily depends on the speed of the running Java environment. Lastly (c), the project structure in Visual Studio makes things overly complicated, and Qt Creator is simple and more importantly, cross-platform.

Once everything is set up correctly, lauch Qt Creator and click File->"Open file or project..." and then nagivate to the powergrid.pro file in the src directory of the git repository.

Open it, and you will get a configuration screen to configure the project settings. Leave the settings as is and click the "Configure project" button. That's all.


## For Mac OS X ##

Download the Qt for Mac library + creator (version 5.0.2) from qt-project.org/downloads.
Run the setup wizard (leaving all settings as-is, although you may change the installation directory).

When the installation is done, open the project file from the src folder (named "powergrid.pro").

You will get a configuration screen to configure the project settings. Leave the settings as is and click the "Configure project" button. That's all.


## For Linux ##

We haven't looked into getting PowerGrid to compile on Linux yet, but it should be similar to Mac OS X. If you got it to work on Linux, please let us know.
