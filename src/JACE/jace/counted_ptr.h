/**
 * This implementation of a reference counted smart pointer 
 * was lifted from Mark E's website. Originally, I attempted 
 * to make use of boost::shared_ptr, but its inclusion 
 * was cumbersome, due to the slew of dependencies
 * it held upon other files. Simply using the entire Boost library
 * was out of the question, as its size and scope greatly dwarfs my own.
 * I've taken care to place counted_ptr in the Jace namespace to prevent
 * possible collisions with other implementations.
 *
 * Chronio: This is only used by Option, so we may be able to rewrite Option
 *          to make this completely obsolete.
 *
 * Mark's copyright notice appears below.
