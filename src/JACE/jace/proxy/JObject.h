/**
 * \brief The abstract base class for all C++ proxy objects generated for java.
 *
 * These proxy classes are a C++ representation of the corresponding
 * java class.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * In addition to the rules in the JValue class, JObject's must
 * also adhere to the following set of rules:
 *
 * - All JObject's must be constructable from a JNI jobject.
 *   For example: String::String( jobject ).
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * JObjects may be created from existing jobjects, or they may
 * create new jobjects.
 *
 * For example, the code:
 * {
 *   String string;
 * }
 *
 * creates a new java.lang.String through JNI.
 *
 * The code:
 *
 * Java_com_foo_bar( jobject this, jstring aString ) {
 *   String( aString );
 * }
 *
 * does not create a new java.lang.String, but simply wraps an
 * existing java.lang.String in a C++ String class wrapper.
 *
 * In both cases, String creates a global reference to the jstring,
 * and does not release that global reference until it's lifetime
 * has ended.
